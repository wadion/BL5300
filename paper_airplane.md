# These are instructions to make a paper airplane.
# This paper airplane will not look nice.
# But it is still a paper airplane.
1. Place an 8.5" x 11" piece of paper in front of you in the portrait orientation.
1. Fold the paper in half by folding the right side of the paper on top of the left side.
1. Take the top right corner of the top fold and peel it back over the top fold until you make a triangle.
1. Repeat this same step for the other side.
1. Return the paper to the original side.
1. Take the left side of the top fold and fold it over the top side so that the left most edge touched the right edge.
1. Repeat this for the other side.
# Now you have a paper airplane.
